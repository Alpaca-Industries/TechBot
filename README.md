# Pepeboy

This is a not basic setup of a Discord bot using [Sapphire Framework](https://www.sapphirejs.com/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) written in TypeScript

## How to use it?

You Don't

### Prerequisite

```sh
npm install
```

### Development

This makes TSUP watch the files and recompile and restart on change.

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Production

You can also run the bot with `npm dev`, this will first build your code and then run `node ./dist/index.js`. But this is not the recommended way to run a bot in production.
