This is a not basic setup of a Discord bot using the [sapphire framework][sapphire] written in TypeScript

## How to use it?

You Don't

### Prerequisite

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Development

This makes TSUP watch the files and recompile and restart on change.

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Production

You can also run the bot with `npm dev`, this will first build your code and then run `node ./dist/index.js`. But this is not the recommended way to run a bot in production.
